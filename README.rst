Background
----------

*Systems Administration for Cyborgs* is a book-like object that
introduces basic systems administration concepts, practices, and
problems, to technical audiences without traditional systems
administration experience: developers/engineers, project managers,
architects, managers, and so forth.

Systems administration is changing, and most people who work
extensively will find themselves doing administrative work at some
point, and this document serves as an introduction to basic systems
administration for contemporary systems administrators.
