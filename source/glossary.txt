   rsync
      ``rsync`` is a UNIX application that provides a very efficient
      method for copying files between hosts. It saves transit by
      identifying and only copying data that has changed on the source
      host. ``rsync`` is a replacement for utilities including:
      ``ftp``, ``scp``, and ``rcp``.

   LVM
      The logical volume manager is a Linux subsystem that abstracts
      the storage system so that "disk images" can be re-sized and
      managed independently of the physical disk. Furthermore LVM
      provides a capacity for fast disk snapshots which make it easy
      to duplicate disk images at points in time.

   NoSQL
      The marketing term given to a class of largely non-relational
      databases that have emerged since 2004 in an attempt to deal
      with a number of different architectural and interface problems
      with relational/SQL database systems. Examples include MongoDB,
      CouchDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, Riak, and other. While there
      commonalities, all NoSQL databases are typically quite
      specialized.

   REST
      "Representational state transfer," a distributed application
      design paradigm that inspired the HTTP protocol. More
      recently application developers use "REST" and the ideas of
      "RESTfulness" to describe application programming interfaces
      (APIs) for web services. REST typically contrasts with stateful
      protocols like SOAP and XML-RPC

   key/value
      A way of representing data structures where each object consists
      of two parts: a "key" or indexed descriptor, and a "value," or
      datum. Using key-value pairs its possible to store and represent
      much more complex data structures.

   metadata
      Secondary information concerning a primary information
      object. For example, classification number, publication date,
      publisher, and author are all potential "metadata" points for
      a book object.

   log rotation
      The process of truncating, moving, compressing, and eventually
      deleting application and daemon log files to prevent the logs
      from growing out of proportion. The application "logrotate" is
      used by most UNIX-like distributions to implement log rotation.

   copy-on-write
      A pattern used to take snapshots and ensure atomic file system
      operation. Simply, rather than "copy" an object by duplicating
      its representation, copy-on-write systems create references to
      the original object's constituents, and then the system copies
      data only as the oringal object's 'constituents change.

   virtual hosting
      A method of including a host name in the request to allow a
      single process to provide multiple services. This is typically
      used in the context of :doc:`HTTP services
      <web-services-architecture>` to provide :term:`multi-tenancy`,
      but appears in other contexts as well.

   multi-tenancy
      The practice of using a single system to provide multiple
      services. While this can lead to more efficient use of resources
      in some situations and by some providers. Multi-tenancy can make
      it hard to correlate observed performance, server configuration
      changes, and can cause actual performance issues.

   inetd
      A core UNIX process that listens to network interfaces and
      spawns processes in response.

   grokable
      Understandable or knowable. From "grok." Derived from Robert
      Heinlein's *Stranger in a Strange Land*.

   grok
      To understand or to know. Derived from Robert Heinlein's
      *Stranger in a Strange Land*.

   NCSA
      National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Located at the
      University of Illinois Campaign-Urbana, the NCSA is notable for
      hosting many developments, including the development of HTTP.

   horizontal scaling
      See ":term:`partitioning`."

   vertical scaling
      See ":term:`replication`."

   syslog
      A standardized multi-system "system logging" system for core
      system events and service logging.

   proxy
      Servers or services which do not originate content but assemble
      content or provide a single access point for a number of
      distinct processes or different servers by acting as a "pass
      through," for this content or resource (group.) Proxy servers
      provide a number of distinct intermediary functionality at a
      number of levels of abstraction and operation.

   good enough
      A theory regarding the development and adoption of "bleeding
      edge" technologies that asserts that "the best" or most advanced
      technologies are not always the best solutions or the best
      expenditure of resources.

   virtualization
      The practice of using hypervisor technology to
      provide :term:`multi-tenancy` on a system-level. These
      virtualized hosts (i.e. servers,) provide abstracted hardware
      interfaces so that administrators can deploy multiple systems,
      instances, or nodes on a single piece of hardware. Virtualized
      instances are generally entirely separate from other systems
      running on the same hardware.

   host
      Refers to a single system in a networked environment. With
      virtualization, each instance is a host on the
      network. Typically each host has a single and distinct network
      address but :term:`IPv4 address space depletion` and :term:`NAT`
      obscure this boundary somewhat.

   replication
      A distributed architecture where the resource exists
      *redundantly* in multiple locations. Examples include RAID
      level-1 and master-slave database architectures.

   partitioning
      A distributed architecture that divides  a single copy of a single
      logical resource among a collection of nodes so that each member
      of the "cluster" provides a non-identical portion of the resource. In
      databases this is often called "sharding," but a similar effects
      are possible for other types of services. While there is often
      some conceptual overhead for these kinds of clusters, they often
      allow administrators and users to greatly increase overall
      system capacity.

   NAT
      Network address translation. The network routing approach that
      allows multiple hosts in the local network to share a single
      publicly routable address.

   IPv4 address space depletion
      The process where the 32-bit address space for the global IPv4
      network (i.e. the "Internet") runs out of usable addresses for
      hosts. The problem is a result of many factors: a much larger
      number of hosts on the internet than expected, poor early
      address allocation methods, and routing requirements that
      consume, on average, 2-4 addresses for every block of
      256 addresses.

   resource
      A specific piece of content provided by a networked
      service. Typically used in the context of HTTP.

   continuous integration
      A system that regularly and automatically builds software and
      runs tests to ensure that throughout the development process,
      the software continues to function and that a larger (or
      smaller) team of developers does not create regressions or
      introduce conflicting changes. By operating regularly and
      "continuously," these build systems are able to prevent
      difficult release processes. "CI" tools include "buildbot,"
      "Jenkins," "Hudson," and "Travis-CI."

   ACL
      Access control lists. A mechanism for describing permissions
      in a complex system. While the implementations vary, ACL systems
      generally consist of: a list of available permissions, a list of
      users with specific permissions, and "groups" of users (and
      nested groups) that also have permissions. While ACLs can become
      very complex and unmanageable, as of 2012 there is no
      alternative method of granular permissions management.

   monitoring
      Monitoring systems consist of applications and services that
      collect data on an ongoing basis about a system to provide
      troubleshooting and early alerting on potential problems.

      .. seealso:: ":doc:`monitoring-tactics`"

   higher availability
      The practice of making services resilient to various kinds of
      "likely failures," by deploying a combination of
      :term:`redundant <redundancy>` systems, automated
      :term:`failover` and recovery infrastructure.

      .. seealso:: ":doc:`high-availability`"

   cloud computing
      A buzz word that captures :term:`utility billing`,
      virtualization, client-server applications (i.e. Web
      Applications) and service oriented architecture (typical
      of the RESTful-type.)

   utility billing
      A method of pricing technological infrastructure that meters
      resource usage, and charges users only for what they use.

   SSL SNI
      Secure Socket Layer, Server Name Indicator. The specification
      which will allow HTTPS clients to specify the hostname
      (i.e. "server name") during the SSL negotiation process so that
      servers will be able to provide multiple HTTPS sites on a single
      IP address.

   signpost
      A rhetorical device, useful in documentation, where the writer
      takes a step back and gives the reader context to help them
      understand and use the resource more effectively. These
      contextualizations can describe what a document or section
      contains or may inform the reader about a specific section's
      importance. While some documentation may contain too much
      "signposting," well placed signposts, in general, help to make
      documentation more :term:`grokable <grok>` and useful.

   pipe
      An inter-process communication metaphor that allows processes on
      Unix-like systems to communicate by sending the output of the
      first program, in standard plain-text format, to the input of
      the second program.
