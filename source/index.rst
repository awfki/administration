Systems Administration for Cyborgs
==================================

Today, everyone is a systems administrator, thankfully there's no
training that anyone can give you so that you become a rock star sys
admin: we're all equally qualified. *Systems Administration for
Cyborgs* is a collection of essays that provide an introduction to
various systems administration topics in the context of late-early
20th century technological phenomena: cloud computing, database driven
web applications, virtualization, Linux, and dev/ops.
