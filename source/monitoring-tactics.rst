Infrastructure Monitoring for Everyone
======================================

Monitoring refers to the practice of collecting regular data regarding
your infrastructure in order to provide alerts both of unplanned
downtime, network intrusion, and resource saturation as well as
auditable records of the same and other crucial operational
data. Often this data is important for forensic investigations and in
determining the root cause of errors. Monitoring provides the basis
for the most objective analysis es in systems administration and IT in
general.

Collecting these data presents its own set of technological problems,
and unlike some domains, the general purpose monitoring tools require
a great deal of customization and configuration for nearly every kind
of deployment. At the same time most specialized monitoring tools only
collect certain types of data and thus need to be integrated into
general purpose systems. There are no easy answers to these issues.

This document provides an overview of the monitoring problem domain
and an introduction to the core strategies and technologies. After
reading this document, I hope that you will have a reasonable
understanding of the most important issues and concerns that face
monitoring administrators and users.
