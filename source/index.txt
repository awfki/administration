==================================
Systems Administration for Cyborgs
==================================

Everyone these days is a systems administrator at some scale. While
there has never been good formal training for systems administration,
it's no easier to learn how to administer systems today than it was
ten or twenty years ago. *Systems Administration for Cyborgs* is a
collection of essays that provide an introduction to various systems
administration topics in the context of late-early 20th century
technological phenomena: cloud computing, database driven web
applications, virtualization, Linux, and dev/ops.
