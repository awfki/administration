   rsync
      ``rsync`` is a UNIX application that provides a very efficient
      method for copying files between hosts. It saves transit by
      identifying and only copying that data which is different and
      has been updated. ``rsync`` serves as a replacement for
      utilities like: ``ftp``, ``scp``, and ``rcp``.

   LVM
      The logical volume manager is a Linux subsystem that abstracts
      the storage system so that "disk images" can be re-sized and
      managed independently of the physical disk. Furthermore LVM
      provides a capacity for fast disk snapshots which make it easy
      to duplicate disk images at points in time.

   NoSQL
      The marketing term given to a class of largely non-relational
      databases that have emerged since 2004 in an attempt to deal
      with a number of different architectural and interface problems
      with relational/SQL database systems. Examples include MongoDB,
      CouchDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, Riak, and other. While there
      commonalities, all NoSQL databases are typically quite
      specialized.
